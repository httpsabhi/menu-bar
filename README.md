# HTML Code
It uses the Font Awesome icon library and includes a custom CSS file called "style.css" for styling.

The menu bar consists of an unordered list <ul> with class "mcd-menu" that contains several list items <li>, each representing a menu item. Each menu item is represented by an anchor <a> tag with various Font Awesome icons and text content.

Here's a breakdown of the structure:

The first menu item represents the "Home" page and is marked as active with the "active" class.
The second menu item represents the "About Us" page.
The third menu item represents the "Features" page.
The fourth menu item represents the "News" page.
The fifth menu item represents the "Blog" page and includes a nested unordered list <ul> for sub-menu items.
The sub-menu items represent different sections of the blog, such as "Missions" and "Our Team."
The "Our Team" sub-menu item includes another nested unordered list for team members.
Each team member has their own nested sub-menu items for "About" and "Skills."
The sixth menu item represents the "Portfolio" page.
The seventh menu item represents the "Contacts" page.
The last menu item is a search input field with a search button.
Overall, this code represents a hierarchical menu structure with nested sub-menus for the blog and team sections. The styling and behavior of the menu are likely defined in the "style.css" file referenced in the HTML markup.
  
# CSS Code
It includes media queries to adjust the styling based on different screen sizes. Here's a breakdown of the code:

The .clearfix class is used to clear floats.
The .container class is a container element for the menu.
The .mcd-menu class is applied to the menu itself.
The rest of the CSS rules define various styles for the menu and its items, such as background, padding, margins, colors, borders, transitions, animations, etc.
Media queries are used to define different styles for different screen sizes, ranging from large screens to mobile devices.
It seems like this code defines a responsive menu with dropdown submenus. The menu items can have icons, text, and additional information displayed. The styling changes based on the screen size to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience on different devices.
